OpenCL bindings for Ruby

Up to date OpenCL bindings for Ruby. Written using FFI but heavily inspired by Seiya Nishizawa's work on the C bindings.

Two ruby gems can be built from this repository:

- narray_ffi which add the necessary mechanism to NArrays so that they can be used as data buffers with FFI.
- opencl_ruby_ffi which provides the actual bindings.
